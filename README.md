# Egk Rave Cryptography

_last update 12/27/2023_

This is the kotlin/java code for RAVE cryptography. It builds on top of 

* [ElectionGuard-Kotlin](https://github.com/votingworks/electionguard-kotlin-multiplatform)
* [Verificatum Mixnet](https://www.verificatum.org/)

See [RAVE Cryptography Implementation](https://github.com/votingworks/rave-cryptography-implementation) for more information.

Library dependencies are summarized [here](dependencies.txt).

## Install

This version is completely self-contained, by including a copy of the electionguard and verificatum jars in it.
This means you dont have to install verificatum at all, since egk-rave provides wrappers around the verificatum
library.

````
cd <install-dir>
git clone https://github.com/votingworks/egk-rave.git
cd egk-rave
````

If you're on a basic Linux and need to install Java and Kotlin the first time:

````
./scripts/install-basic.sh
````

## Build

To build the code:

````
./gradlew clean assemble
````

If the library has changed and you need to update it:

````
cd ~/dev/github/egk-rave:
git fetch origin
git rebase -i origin/main
````

Then rebuild the code:

````
./gradlew clean assemble
````

## Sample Workflow for testing

````
~/dev/github/egk-rave:$ ./scripts/runCompleteWorkflow.sh
````

Runs a complete test of the RAVE workflow and writes the output to the _working_ subdirectory. [Sample Output](docs/workflowOutput.txt)

The components of this workflow are:

###  initialize-election.sh working

1. Deletes the working directory and starts fresh.
2. Uses _famous-names-election.json_ to create an electionguard _manifest.json_.
3. Create an electionguard configuration file with default election parameters.
4. Runs the electionguard keyceremony to create private trustee keys and a public election key.

###  generate-and-encrypt-ballots.sh working nballots

1. Generates random plaintext ballots from the given manifest.
2. Encrypts those ballots with the public key.

###  tally-encrypted-ballots.sh working

1. Homomorphically accumulates encrypted ballots into an encrypted tally.

###  tally-decrypt.sh working

1. Uses trustee keys to decrypt the tally.

###  make-mixnet-input.sh working

1. Writes encrypted ballots to the format that the verificatum mixnet requires.

###  mixnet-initialize.sh working

1. Initializes the verificatum mixnet.

###  mixnet-shuffle.sh working

1. Shuffles the ballots using two shuffling phases, and writes out the shuffled ballots and their proof of shuffle.

###  copy-to-bb.sh working

1. Copies the needed information from the working directories to the public bulletin board.

###  mixnet-verify.sh working

1. Runs the verificatum verifier on the mixnet proofs.

###  pep-compare.sh working

1. Creates a separate encoding of the plaintext ballots to simulate the paper ballot encryption.
2. Uses the serial numbers to match the paper ballot encryptions to the mixnet shuffled ballots. Requires knowledge of the trustee keys.
3. Compares these with the PEP (Plaintext Equivalence Proof) algorithm.
4. Writes out the PEP proofs for each ballot.

###  pep-verify.sh working

1. Validates the PEP proofs.

Notes

1. encryptedPaperBallots/ and pep/ only exist if pep-compare.sh is run.
2. Note that when the "paper ballots" are encrypted, the ballot id is removed.
